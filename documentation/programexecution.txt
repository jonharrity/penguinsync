A condensed version of what happens when PenguinSync is run:


~Part 1 (init)
    -Check if data files exist; create them if necessary
    ~Startup connection to Google Drive
        -Load credentials stored on user's file system
        -If credentials do not exist, begin the OAuth2 flow to
            login and store the credentials
        -Use credentials to initialize the drive service
    
~Part 2 (sync)
    ~On first sync every program execution
        -Check last update time of files on Google Drive
        -If either the google drive version or the local version of a file is more
            up to date, update the other
    -Generate list of every file not up to date on the Drive
    -Update every file on this list

    -(currently disabled) every x minutes, sync again
