While every locally synced file is listed in /data/*, a config file containing 
global application data is stored on a user's drive in the Application Data folder. 


Currently the id of the folder used to store all synced files is called
Constants.DRIVE_BASE_DIR
and its id is stored under the attribute 'base_folder_id' in the config file.


(json)
{
    'base_folder_id': id
