For a description of application data stored on a user's Google Drive, see configfileondrive.txt.

All other application data is stored in /data. 
There are three files there: 'did', 'lsy', and 'msf'.
All three files are created via python's 'pickle' functions, and contain either
a dictionary or a list.


-'msf':
     -> Managed Sub Folders is a list of every folder on the user's file system
        which contains files that are being synced.
        
-'did':
     -> Drive IDs is a dictionary; each key is a full filepath on the user's file
        system and maps to the corresponding file id on their Google Drive.
        
-'lsy': 
     -> Last Synced is a dictionary; each key is a full filepath on the user's file
        system and maps to the last time the file was updated.
        
        
        
did and lsy are of the same size and contain the same key list. There is a redundancy
in storing this same data twice, and this issue will be resolved in the future.
